Below is my writeup for the CTF challenge "Naptime" from uiuctf24, written back in June 2024.

This writeup won in the CTF's [writeup competition](https://82dd9c84.sigpwny-com.pages.dev/events/uiuctf/2024/) - you can see the [original version at the time of competition](https://github.com/awrreny/CTFthings/tree/main/writeups/uiuctf24/crypto/naptime). This version is slightly modified for clarity.

## Naptime

### Setup

-   Implements a variant of the [Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Hellman_knapsack_cryptosystem), where the TODO list is shuffled and each character is encrypted separately.

---

### tl;dr

-   Each character is encrypted separately making brute force very easy.
-   After the CTF I read [a paper on knapsack cryptosystem attacks](http://paper.ijcsns.org/07_book/202009/20200922.pdf) where I learned and implemented the intended lattice-based solution, which would work even if the characters were not encrypted separately.

### Solution 1 - Brute force

Each character is encrypted separately, leading to a security level of $2^8 = 256$, which is very easy to brute force.
In this case, I do this by looping through each possible ASCII char, encrypting it, storing the result in a dictionary, then using the dictionary to directly convert each `ct` element to a character.

```py
import string

def getMappings(a):
    out = dict()
    # for every possible ASCII char
    for char in string.printable:
        out[encrypt(char, a)] = char
    return out

def encrypt(char, a):
    charVal = ord(char)
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if charVal & 1: total += a[i]
        charVal >>= 1
    return total

a =  [66128, 61158, 36912, 65196, 15611, 45292, 84119, 65338]
ct = [273896, 179019, 273896, 247527, 208558, 227481, 328334, 179019, 336714, 292819, 102108, 208558, 336714, 312723, 158973, 208700, 208700, 163266, 244215, 336714, 312723, 102108, 336714, 142107, 336714, 167446, 251565, 227481, 296857, 336714, 208558, 113681, 251565, 336714, 227481, 158973, 147400, 292819, 289507]

mapping = getMappings(a)
print("".join([mapping[element] for element in ct]))
```

### Solution 2 - Lattices

I am new to LLL so there may be errors: I apologise in advance!
This writeup is aimed towards those who are new to lattices and knapsack cryptosystems, mainly because that was my position when I started this challenge.

<!--
i just implemented the low density attack from http://paper.ijcsns.org/07_book/202009/20200922.pdf (at theorem 3.2) -->

Wikipedia has a good [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Hellman_knapsack_cryptosystem) of the implemented cryptosystem for the curious, but for this solution all the private information doesn't matter because this solution solves the knapsack problem directly.

While this is called a knapsack cryptosystem, it uses a more specific problem called the subset sum problem, where given a list of numbers and a target sum, we want to find a subset of the numbers which sum to the target.

This cryptosystem relies on this problem being hard to solve (NP-Complete), however in this implementation it isn't hard: because the bit length of the elements of `a` are much larger than the amount of elements, this knapsack has low 'density' and the problem can be solved efficiently with a lattice-based attack.

The 'density' of a knapsack is a rough indicator of how crowded the sums are, that is, many different subsets of the elements can sum to the same or very similar values.

#### Lattices and LLL brief intro

[Video intro to lattices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDdOoYdb748)

LLL is an algorithm which can quickly find a good, small basis from a bad basis. For example, given $(7, 3), (2, 1)$ it will output $(1, 0), (0, 1)$. Both bases represent the same lattice, so the good basis vectors are each an integer linear combination of the bad basis vectors.

It can be used in non-lattice cryptosystems by transforming the decryption problem into one involving vectors and a lattice, where public information is represented in the large input basis vectors. The basis is constructed in such a way so that the LLL output contains private information which can be used to solve the problem.

---

Notice that when the message is encoded as a vector (e.g. 010110 -> [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]), it is very short compared to the elements of `a`, so it would be a good idea to try making the message vector the LLL output.
This [paper](http://paper.ijcsns.org/07_book/202009/20200922.pdf) describes the following lattice:

```py
M = [
    [1, 0, 0, ..., 0, -a1],
    [0, 1, 0, ..., 0, -a2],
    [0, 0, 1, ..., 0, -a3],
    [...],
    [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, -an],
    [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, s]
    # where a1, a2, ... are elements of a, and s is their sum
    # forming a square matrix with n + 1 rows and columns
]
```

For this lattice, the intended linear combination is `(all rows with ai in the sum) + (the last vector)`, resulting in `[message] + [0]` (for the last column). For example if `n = 3` and `s = a1 + a3` then one of the output vectors would be `[1, 0, 0, -a1] + [0, 0, 1, -a3] + [0, 0, 0, s]` = `[1, 0, 1, 0]` where the message is `101`.

The last column is constructed so that a correct solution to the knapsack problem will have the last element = `0`, making it a short vector and more likely to appear in the LLL output. However, running LLL on this lattice may still output vectors where the last element is not `0`. To solve this we can multiply the entire last column by some constant, which 'punishes' incorrect solutions by increasing their last element, making the vector larger and less likely to appear in the LLL output.

The paper also suggests filling the last row with 1/2 but the knapsack's density is low enough so that it works without this adjustment.

    M[n, n] = N*s

    M = M.LLL()
    print(M)
    validLattice, solution = find_solution(M)
    assert validLattice, M

    return chr(int("".join([str(bit) for bit in solution]), 2))


print("".join(decryptChar(char) for char in ct))
